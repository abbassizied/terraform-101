## LocalStack
> LocalStack is a local cloud emulator that lets you build and test cloud applications entirely on your machine. Spin up fully functional local environments that mirror real cloud behavior — including AWS services and Snowflake — without provisioning real cloud infrastructure. Whether you're validating IaC templates, running integration tests, or iterating on data pipelines, LocalStack integrates seamlessly with your tools and CI/CD pipelines to help you ship faster and safer.
- 
- 
```sh
$ localstack --version # To verify that the LocalStack CLI was installed correctly
$ localstack start -d # start localstack in background with -d flag
```
- **Updating LocalStack CLISection titled “Updating LocalStack CLI”**: The LocalStack CLI allows you to easily update the different components of LocalStack. To check the various options available for updating, run:
```sh
localstack update --help
```
- **Note:** Updating the LocalStack CLI using localstack update localstack-cli and localstack update all will work only if it was installed from the Python distribution. If it was installed using the pre-built binary or via Brew, please run the installation steps again to update to the latest version.
